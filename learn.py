# python datastructure are divided into two built-in and user defined 

"""
builtin are lists, tuple, dictionary and sets

list are ordered and can be nested and mutable and items can be accessed using index 

tuple are ordered and can be accessed using index they are faster than list 

A tuple with single item can be created using 

new_tuple = (7, )

tuple are immutable and can be nested

Dictionaries are unordered and can be accessed using keys 

dicitionaries are mutable 

it can be looped using dictionaries.items()
